# Modeling the Decline/Rise of CO2 Emissions in Various Countries to Pinpoint Specific Problem Sectors and Recommend Funding Allocation
* An exploration of CO2 emissions in relation to national funding trends
* Aims to use two mathematical models (one to visualize the decline and rise of CO2 emissions in a selection of countries and another to visualize national funding trends) to pinpoint specific problem sectors and recommend funding allocations
